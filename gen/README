How code generation works
-------------------------

The NGit code is automatically generated from the JGit code using the Sharpen
utility, provided by db4o. Some documentation about this tool can be found here:

http://developer.db4o.com/Projects/html/projectspaces/db4o_product_design/sharpen.html
http://developer.db4o.com/Documentation/Reference/db4o-7.12/java/reference/html/reference/sharpen.html

However, Sharpen is not perfect and some manual changes in the code are still required.
Those changes are done by using two patches:

 - pre-generation patch, applied to the Java code before code generation
 - post-generation patch, applied to the generated C# code

The Makefile in this directory has targets for automatically downloading, patching and
converting the JGit code.

Generating the NGit code
------------------------

To generate the NGit code from the latest JGit code, run the following commands:

1) make pull

This command will pull the JGit source code, together with the required libraries.
After getting the code, it will try to apply the pre-generation patch.
This operation may result in conflicts (since the java code may have changed).
In that case, the conflicts have to be manually resolved. To do it:
 - cd to the 'source' subdirectory
 - fix the reported conflics
 - run 'git add somefile.java' for every solved conflict
 - run 'git rebase --continue' to finish the merge

2) make convert

This command will convert the new java code to C#, and will apply the post-generation
patch. This patch can also cause merge conflicts. To fix the conflics, cd to the
'generated' subdirectory and follow the same steps explained above.

3) make import

This command will copy the generated source code to the NGit project.

Updating the pre and post generation patches
--------------------------------------------

Sometimes you'll have to manually modify the java code or the generated C# code in order
for the library to build. When all changes are done, run 'make update-patch' to include
your manual changes in the pre/post generation patches.
