ABOUT NGIT
----------

NGit is a port of JGit [1] to C#. This port is generated semi-automatically
using Sharpen [2], a Java-to-C# conversion utility.

NGit provides all functionality implemented by JGit, including all repository
manipulation primitives and transport protocols. SSH support is provided by
a port of jsch [3], included in the project.

The project is composed by 4 libraries:
- NGit: The git library.
- NGit.Test: Unit tests for NGit
- NSch: The port of jsch.
- Sharpen: Some support classes required by the above libraries.

The code included in this project is already converted, so to use it
you just have to open the ngit.sln solution and build it.

Instructions and tools for updating and regenerating the NGit code from JGit
are available in the 'gen' subdirectory.
